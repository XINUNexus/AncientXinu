In order to download Xinu, the exception vectors must be initialized 
to point to a panic routine.  This is done in lowcore.s.  Ron Ginosar
said that the assembler is a vax assembler hacked for the mc68000.
Beware of null-padding.  When skipping  blocks of memory, the assembler,
null pads.

    The "org" instruction can be used to set the location counter.
    it takes as an argument an expression such as:
	table:	org	6
    which sets table to decimal location 6.
    and then:
		org	table+10
    which allocates 10 bytes for table.

Accessing an address beyond physical memory that is not mapped is a BUS error.

When the pc and ps are pushed down on an exception (other than bus error
and address error), the order is:
	(low)	ps
		pc high order word
	(high)	pc low  order word

for a total of 6 bytes (not  8).

A picture of the exception table is on page 15-7 of  68000 A.S.P.

The vivmon code is in /usr/m/dist1/vivmon/.

The exception vectors  for vivmon are set up in vivmon/except.s.

USART interrupts trap to  0x74 -- level 5 interrupt.

Xinu11 starts at  01000  (0x200).
Xinu68 starts at 010000 (0x1000).

sizmem.s must be written -- see how the monitor for mx does it.
For now, have sizmem return a constant (0x40000).

The csr structure must be changed, however, the name , "csr", should 
be kept.

For the tty driver, change all references to the csr to macro calls.
In Xinu11, these macro calls will be replaced by simple in-line calls,
in Xinu68, however, they will be replaced by actual procedure calls for
the most part.

Also, have getc return an integer, with the one byte having the character
read, and the other a constant code signifying the error detected in
transmission.
